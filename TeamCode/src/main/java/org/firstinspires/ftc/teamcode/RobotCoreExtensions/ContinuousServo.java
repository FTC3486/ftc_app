/**
 *
 * Filename: ContinuousServo.java
 *
 * Description:
 *     This class contains the methods to use Continuous Servo.
 *
 *     NOTE: If you are looking for FIRST's built-in Continuous Servo implementation, it's called
 *     CRServo
 *
 *     While most servos go to a specific location based on the signal received, the Continuous
 *     servo rotates at a specific speed based on that signal. Â Its speed is fully proportional
 *     meaning that the further the signal deviates from the center (1500usec), the faster the
 *     servo will rotate.
 *
 *     Normally for a Continuous Servo a positive signal of 0 to < .5 signal would turn the servo
 *     backwards and >.5 to 1 signal would turn the servo forward.
 *
 *     This method uses positive signals to go forward and negative signals to go backwards
 *     to simplify programing.
 *
 * Methods:
 *      ContinuousServo
 *      setPower - 0 to 1 signals the servo to go forward. 0 to -1 signals the servo to go backwards.
 *
 * Example: Rover.hardwareConfiguration.continuousServo.setPower(0.5);

 *
 * Requirements:
 *     - Continuous Servos

 *     -Created by Matthew on 2/2/2016.
